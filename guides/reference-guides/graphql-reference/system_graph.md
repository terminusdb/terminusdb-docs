# System Graph interface to GraphQL

TerminusDB also exposes its internal working graphs, the system graph,
the meta graph and the commit graph. These three graphs can be queried
with a self-documenting GraphQL interface by going to the appropriate
api for a data product.

# System Graph

For instance, to get *only* system graph access, you can use the
following endpoint:

```
http://127.0.0.1:6363/api/graphql/_system
```

# Meta Graph

To get the System Graph and Meta graph which belongs to a specific data product you can use the following endpoint:

```
http://127.0.0.1:6363/api/graphql/ORG/DATA_PRODUCT/_meta
```

# Commit Graph

To get access to branches, commits, commit logs, as well as the meta
and system graph, you can use the following endpoint:

```
http://127.0.0.1:6363/api/graphql/ORG/DATA_PRODUCT/local/_commits
```
