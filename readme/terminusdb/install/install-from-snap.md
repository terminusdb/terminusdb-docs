# Install from Snap

Detailed instructions on the installation can be found at the Snap page: [https://snapcraft.io/terminusdb](https://snapcraft.io/terminusdb)

This is the easiest way to try TerminusDB as a developer on various Linux distributions.

## Limitations

The Snap does not contain a daemon. It is therefore recommended for developers trying TerminusDB. Server administrators are beter
off with either using terminusdb-bootstrap or configuring their own Docker deployment.
